### 1. Document Overview

`huatuo-bamai` is the core collector of HUATUO (a BPF-based metrics and anomaly inspector). Its configuration file defines the data collection scope, probe enablement strategy, metric output format, anomaly detection rules, and logging behavior.

The configuration file uses **TOML** format and includes multiple sections such as global blacklist, logging, runtime resource limits, storage configuration, and AutoTracing. Each configuration item comes with detailed comments explaining its purpose, default value, and important notes. This document provides a clear and detailed English explanation for **every configuration item** to help users understand and safely customize the settings.

**Note**: Most parameters in the configuration file are provided as commented defaults (starting with `#`). To enable them, remove the `#` and adjust the values according to your environment. Changes take effect only after restarting the `huatuo-bamai` process. In production environments, follow the principle of minimalism and avoid enabling high-overhead features unnecessarily.

### 2. Global Blacklist

```bash
# The global blacklist for tracing and metrics
BlackList = ["netdev_hw", "metax_gpu"]
```

- **BlackList**: Global blacklist for tracing and metrics.

  Used to exclude specific modules or hardware from tracing and metric collection, preventing irrelevant noise or high-overhead probes. The default value is ["netdev_hw", "metax_gpu"], which globally disables tracing and metrics related to network device hardware layer (netdev_hw) and Metax GPU.

  **Description**: Adding items to the blacklist can effectively reduce resource consumption, especially in specific hardware environments. It supports array format and can be extended based on actual business needs.

### 3. Logging

```bash
# Log Configuration
#
# - Level
# The log level for huatuo-bamai: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic.
# Default: Info
#
# - File
# Store logs to where the logging file is. If it is empty, don't write log
# to any file.
# Default: empty
#
[Log]
    # Level = "Info"
    # File = ""
```

- **Level**: Log level.

  Default: Info. Possible values: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic.

  **Description**: Controls the verbosity of huatuo-bamai logs. In production, Info or Warn is recommended to reduce log volume. Use Debug only for troubleshooting, as it generates substantial output.

- **File**: Log file path.

  Specifies the path to the log file. If left empty, logs are not written to any file (output goes to stdout or system logs).

  Default: empty.

  **Description**: In containerized deployments, configure a specific path and integrate with a log collection system for persistence.

### 4. Runtime Resource Limits

```bash
# Runtime resource limit
#
# - LimitInitCPU
# During the huatuo-bamai startup, the CPU of process are restricted from use.
# Default is 0.5 CPU.
#
# - LimitCPU
# The CPU resource restricted once the process starts.
# Default is 2.0 CPU.
#
# - LimitMem
# The memory resource limitted for huatuo-bamai process.
# Default is 2048MB.
#
[RuntimeCgroup]
    # LimitInitCPU = 0.5
    # LimitCPU = 2.0
    # LimitMem = 2048
```

- **LimitInitCPU**: CPU limit during startup phase.

  Restricts CPU cores usable by the huatuo-bamai process during initialization.

  Default: 0.5 CPU.

  **Description**: Prevents excessive CPU usage during startup from affecting host business workloads. Value is in CPU cores (supports decimals).

- **LimitCPU**: Runtime CPU limit.

  Restricts CPU resources after the process has started.

  Default: 2.0 CPU.

  **Description**: Adjust based on node scale and workload. In high-density container environments, lower this value appropriately to ensure business stability.

- **LimitMem**: Memory resource limit.

  Maximum memory allowed for the huatuo-bamai process.

  Default: 2048 MB.

  **Description**: Enforced via cgroup to prevent OOM (Out Of Memory) issues. In production, increase as needed according to collection scale.

### 5. Storage

#### 5.1 Elasticsearch Storage

```bash
# Storage configuration
[Storage]
    # Elasticsearch Storage
    #
    # Disable ES storage if one of Address, Username, Password is empty.

    # Default address is :9200 of localhost. ...
    #
    # - Index
    # Elasticsearch index, a logical namespace that holds a collection of
    # documents for huatuo-bamai.
    # Default: huatuo_bamai
    #
    # - Username
    # - Password
    # There is no default username and password.
    #
    [Storage.ES]
        # Address = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
        # Index = "huatuo_bamai"

- **Password**: ES authentication password.

  No default value (example uses huatuo-bamai).

  **Description**: Used together with the username. In production, use a strong password and enable TLS encryption.

**Overall**: ES storage persists kernel tracing and event data for later search and analysis.

#### 5.2 Local File Storage

```bash
# LocalFile Storage

### 7. Event Tracing

This section is responsible for capturing key kernel events and monitoring latency, including softirq, memory reclaim, network receive latency, network device events, and packet drop monitoring. It is the core module for kernel-level anomaly context collection in HUATUO.

#### 7.1 Softirq Disable Tracing

```bash
# linux kernel events capturing configuration
[EventTracing]
	# softirq
	#
	# tracing the softirq disabled events of linux kernel.
	#
	# - DisabledThreshold
	# When the disable duration of softirq exceeds the threshold, huatuo-bamai
	# will collect kernel context.
	# Default: 10000000 in nanoseconds, 10ms
	#
	[EventTracing.Softirq]
		# DisabledThreshold = 10000000
```

- **DisabledThreshold**: Softirq disable duration threshold (nanoseconds).

  Default: 10,000,000 ns (10ms). When softirq is disabled longer than this threshold, kernel context is collected.

  **Description**: Long softirq disable periods can cause delays in networking, timers, etc. Useful for diagnosing interrupt storms or high-load scenarios.

#### 7.2 Memory Reclaim Blocking Tracing

```bash
# memreclaim
#
# The memory reclaim may block the process, if one process is blocked
# for a long time, reporting the events to userspace.
#
# - BlockedThreshold
# The blocked time when memory reclaiming.
# Default: 900000000ns, 900ms
#
[EventTracing.MemoryReclaim]
	# BlockedThreshold = 900000000
```

- **BlockedThreshold**: Memory reclaim blocking time threshold (nanoseconds).

  Default: 900,000,000 ns (900ms). When a process is blocked by memory reclaim for longer than this time, an event is reported to userspace with context.

  **Description**: Memory reclaim blocking is a common cause of process stalls, especially in memory-constrained cloud-native environments.

#### 7.3 Network Receive Latency Tracing

```bash

# This is a string slice in vendor/k8s.io/api/core/v1/types.go
# - PodQOSGuaranteed = "Guaranteed"
# - PodQOSBurstable = "Burstable"
# - PodQOSBestEffort = "BestEffort"
#
# Default: []
#
# - ExcludedHostNetnamespace
# Don't care the skbs, packets in the host net namespace.
# Default: true
#
[EventTracing.NetRxLatency]
	# Driver2NetRx = 5
	# Driver2TCP = 10
	# Driver2Userspace = 115
	# ExcludedContainerQos = []
	ExcludedContainerQos = ["bestEffort"]

	DeviceList = ["eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo"]
```

- **DeviceList**: List of network devices to monitor.

  Default example includes "eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo". An empty list means no devices are monitored.

  **Description**: Monitors physical link status events for specified network interfaces.

#### 7.5 Packet Drop Monitoring

```bash
# dropwatch
#
# monitor packets dropped events in the Linux kernel.
#
# - ExcludedNeighInvalidate
# Don't care of neigh_invalidate drop events.
# Default: true
#
[EventTracing.Dropwatch]
	# ExcludedNeighInvalidate = true
```

- **ExcludedNeighInvalidate**: Whether to exclude packet drops caused by neigh_invalidate.

  Default: true.

  **Description**: Neighbor table related drops are usually normal behavior; excluding them reduces false positives.

### 8. Metric Collector

# "/path/to/kubelet-client-current.pem"
#
# You can disable this kubelet fetching pods, for bare metal service, by
# KubeletReadOnlyPort = 0, and KubeletAuthorizedPort = 0.

[Pod]
	KubeletClientCertPath = "/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt,/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key"
```

- **KubeletReadOnlyPort**: Kubelet read-only port.

  Default: 10255. Set to 0 to disable this method.

- **KubeletAuthorizedPort**: Kubelet HTTPS authorized port.

  Default: 10250. Set to 0 to disable.

- **KubeletClientCertPath**: Path to kubelet client certificate and private key. Supports comma-separated files or single PEM file.

  **Description**: Used for mTLS authentication on the HTTPS port. In non-Kubernetes (bare-metal) environments, set both ports to 0 to disable Pod fetching.

### 10. Best Practices and Important Notes

- **Resource Control**: In production, prioritize adjusting CPU and memory limits in [RuntimeCgroup] to avoid impacting business containers.
- **Storage Choice**: For small-scale deployments, prefer [Storage.LocalFile] for local troubleshooting. For large clusters, configure Elasticsearch for centralized storage and querying.
- **AutoTracing Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on workload characteristics. Thresholds that are too low cause frequent triggering; thresholds that are too high may miss issues. Validate gradually in a test environment.
- **Security**: Use strong passwords for ES configuration and consider enabling HTTPS. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the configuration file.
- **Compatibility**: Configuration parameters may be affected by kernel version and hardware environment. Always verify with the official HUATUO documentation for your specific setup.

By properly configuring huatuo-bamai.conf, you can fully leverage HUATUO’s capabilities in kernel-level anomaly detection and intelligent tracing, significantly improving observability and troubleshooting efficiency in cloud-native systems.
